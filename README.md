## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd t3clone
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Required - Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Optional - Default API Keys (Recommended for Easy User Experience)
# These keys will be used as fallbacks when users don't provide their own
# Users can still override these by adding their own keys in Settings

# OpenAI API Key (Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Google AI API Key (Get from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)  
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# OpenRouter API Key (Get from: https://openrouter.ai/keys)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here

# Optional - Ollama Configuration
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434

### API Key Strategy
**New Feature**: This app now supports a **default API key system** that provides an amazing user experience:

- **For App Owners**: Add your API keys to the environment variables above
- **For Users**: No setup required! They can start chatting immediately using your default keys
- **Optional Override**: Users can add their own API keys in Settings to use their own quotas
- **Visual Indicators**: The UI clearly shows when default keys vs. user keys are being used

This means users can try your app instantly without any configuration, while power users can still use their own keys!
